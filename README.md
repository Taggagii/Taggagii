  <p>If you like to read for a long time, tear your hair out, and you have a windows computer, then I recommend checking out my C-Games repo</p>
  <p>Otherwise, take a look around to see if you find anything that's of use to you.</p>
  <p>My favorite ones are my sorting algorithm grapher (in Coding-Concepts), my github website, and my grade 12 full-stack final for CS named "web-application" (which is currently private if you cannot find it)</p>
